# React Portfolio

## Description
Having an online portfolio is a necessity and a powerful tool to set yourself apart from others. Online portfolios are more personalized and more in-depth than a resume. They are a way to connect with potential employers and share your work with others in the industry.

For this portfolio, I created a reponsive React application that includes the following:
- A single Header component that appears on multiple pages.
- A single Navigation component within the header that is used to conditionally render the different sections of the portfolio.
- A single Project component that is used multiple times in the Project section.
- A single Footer component that appears on multiple pages.
